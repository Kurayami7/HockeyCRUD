# MVCApp

1. Create one of the following databases based on what is assigned to you by your instructor:
   - **Movie Theatre Database**
      - Create a *Movie Theatre* database
      - Create a table named *show_timings* with columns: show_id, movie_name, start_time, movie_image, duration, screen_number.
      - movie_image must contain a URL to any image online. Make sure the URL you use ends with a ".jpg" or ".png" extensions.
    - **Hockey Database**
        - Create a database named *hockeydb*
        - Create a table named *players* with columns: player_id, player_name, dob, matches,image_url, jersey_number
        - image_url must contain a URL to any image online. Make sure the URL you use ends with a ".jpg" or ".png" extensions.

   - In the view that you generated, display the image from the database within an \<img src\> tag. By default, your image may be shown simply as an URL. But make sure you embed it within an img tag to be displayed as an image.
     
6. Try to beautify the application as much as possible in the given time. Do not spend too much time on this step.
